Description: SQUID executes a combination of RNA-Seq transformation and dampened weighted least-squares deconvolution approaches in predicting the composition of 
  cell mixtures and tissue samples based on concurrent RNA-Seq and scnRNA-Seq profiles. To systematically test the benefit of bulk transformation and deconvolution 
  with SQUID, a leave-one-out cross-validation strategy can also be used; iteratively, concurrent RNA-Seq and scnRNA-Seq profiles of all but one of the samples were 
  used to predict the composition of the remaining sample based on its bulk RNA-Seq profile.
